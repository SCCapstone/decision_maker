			<div class="small-spacing"></div>
			<p class="noTopMargin">
				How often have you reached a stalemate with your friends when trying to figure out where to eat? Or with your significant other who can’t decide what tv show they want to watch? Pocket Poll seeks to fix such group decisions by leveraging personal preferences to produce an optimal choice for a given event.
			</p>
			<h4 class="noBottomMargin">How do I use Pocket Poll?</h4>
			<div class="small-spacing"></div>
			<p class="noTopMargin">
				Pocket Poll utilizes three main features: categories, groups, and events. Categories are collections of choices with ratings. The category can be whatever you want it to be. Movies, food, video games, favorite cephalopod, etc. Each choice has a rating from 0-5, with 0 being the lowest rating and 5 the highest. You can always edit the ratings of your friend’s choices that way your opinion can be heard in groups. If you really like their category, you can even copy it to make your own copy! Categories themselves are independent entities. To be utilized they must be attached to a group.
			</p>
			<p>
				Groups are collections of members and house events. Inside a group you can edit the name, group icon, and some other settings unique to groups such as whether it is private or not. To be able to create events in this group, you must attach a category to it. Groups can have as many categories attached to it as you wish, but an event can only have one category attached to it. Take for example the category Food that is attached to one of your groups. You can create an event called “Lunch” with this category and it will pull all the choices and the ratings that each member has of this category in order to produce the optimal choices.
			</p>
			<p>
				Events have multiple stages possible. The “consider” stage is when group members can decide if they want their choices leveraged by our algorithm. By default, all members of the group are considered. Once this stage ends, our algorithm produces three optimal choices to vote on. The one with the highest vote wins, and the result is displayed to the group along with the start time of the event. At any stage, you can easily add the event to your calendar app!
